    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
        Baked chicken with pineapple and yellow rice!
        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1 pinch poultry seasoning (such as McCormick®)</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>2 cups yellow rice mix</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 (15 ounce) cans pineapple chunks, undrained </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season chicken breasts 
        with poultry seasoning, salt, and black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
        Combine water, yellow rice mix, and soy sauce in a baking dish. 
        Arrange chicken over rice and pour pineapples and juice over chicken.
        </li>
        <li>
    Bake in the preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the 
    center and rice is tender, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer 
    inserted into the center of the chicken should read at least 165 degrees F 
    (74 degrees C).
