<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
     Homemade chicken soup - but you don't have to be sick to deserve or enjoy it -
     you do, so do! Good for body and soul!
    </p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken</li> 
<li>4 carrots, halved</li>
<li>4 stalks celery, halved</li>
<li>1 large onion, halved</li>
<li>water to cover</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li> teaspoon chicken bouillon granules (Optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>    
    <li>
    Put the chicken, carrots, celery and onion in a large soup pot and cover with cold 
    water. Heat and simmer, uncovered, until the chicken meat falls off of the bones 
    (skim off foam every so often).
    </li>

    <li>
    Take everything out of the pot. Strain the broth. Pick the meat off of the bones 
    and chop the carrots, celery and onion. Season the broth with salt, pepper and 
    chicken bouillon to taste, if desired. Return the chicken, carrots, celery and 
    onion to the pot, stir together, and serve.
